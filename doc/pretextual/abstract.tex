This work presents the construction of a dynamic water-tube boiler
simulator. The goal is to develop a reliable and safe way to work with
a system that is similar to the working boiler, using a non linear
dynamic mathematical model to represent the boiler's properties with
relation to variations in several parameters, like pressure and water
and heat flows. It is also presented a way of communicating with the
simulator, in a way that is simple to build new applications to
integrate with it, allowing the development of new drivers for
communicating with other equipments. To ensure the correct functioning
of the simulator, an interface app, a pressure controller and water
level controller will be built.
